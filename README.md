# Expedite

**Expedite** is a javascript **Exp**ression **Edit**or **E**nvironment. It's a simple jQuery plugin for authoring infix expressions in an ergonomic fashion. These expressions can then feature in search filters, queries, rule engines, or anything else you fancy that needs an expression system.

**Expedite** itself does not implement an expression evaluator. It's there only to let your user compose arithmetic and logical expressions without having to type code.
